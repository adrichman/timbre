			<p class="user1"><time>1:23:45</time> Would you say that there are certain situations - and the Huston Plan was one of them - where the president can decide that it's in the best interests of the nation, and do something illegal?</p>
			<p class="user2"><time>1:23:45</time> Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.</p>
			<p class="user3"><time>1:23:45</time> Exactly, exactly. If the president, for example, approves something because of the national security, or in this case because of a threat to internal peace and order of significant magnitude, then the president's decision in that instance is one that enables those who carry it out, to carry it out without violating a law. Otherwise they're in an impossible position.</p>			
			<p class="user1"><time>1:23:45</time> The point is: the dividing line is the president's judgment?</p>
